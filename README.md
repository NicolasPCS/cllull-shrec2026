# SHREC 2026: Retrieval of High-Frequency Geometry in Synthetic Heritage

This track aims to shift the focus of 3D retrieval from global shape matching to the recognition of fine-grained, localized surface details—such as engravings, erosion patterns and reliefs, which are often the defining features of cultural heritage artifacts (e.g., armenian Khachkars).

Key elements of the proposal:
- **Task:** 3D reconstruction and retrieval based on localized surface features from multi-view synthetic renderings.
- **Novel Dataset:** A procedurally generated, semantically annotated synthetic dataset of sculpted stone artifacts, providing full control and a feature-aware ground truth with per-vertex semantic categories (e.g., corners, edges, sculpted reliefs).
- **Evaluation:** A novel "Semantic Weighting Scheme" for evaluation, allowing performance metrics to be weighted by the cultural or structural importance of different surface regions.
- **Replicability:** The synthetic pipeline ensures reproducibilty.

This track is designed to challenge and evaluate the ability of state-of-the-art algorithms to capture high-frequency geometric details critical to heritage documentation and analysis.
